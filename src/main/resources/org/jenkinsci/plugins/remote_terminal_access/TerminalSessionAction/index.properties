blurb=This "interactive terminal" feature provides you a shell access to the computer where the build is happening \
  (in the directory the build is happening.) This is a convenient way to diagnose a hang build, inspect failures that are \
  hard to reproduce elsewhere, and so on. Beware that the build will be kept going until you exit the shell.
