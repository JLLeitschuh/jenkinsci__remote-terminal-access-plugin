blurb=This "interactive terminal" feature provides you a shell access to the computer where the build is happening \
  (in the directory the build is happening.) This is a convenient way to diagnose a hang build, inspect failures that are \
  hard to reproduce elsewhere, and so on. Beware that the build will be kept going until you exit the shell.

  <style>.cmd '{' color:white; background-color:black; font-weight:bold; padding:1em; }</style>\
  <p>\
    You can also access the same interactive terminal through the standard SSH client. \
    Put the following fragment in your <tt>~/.ssh/config</tt>:\
  <pre class=cmd>Host=*.{0}\n\
Port={1}\n\
ProxyCommand=ssh -q -p {1} {0} diagnose-tunnel -suffix .{0} %h\n\
</pre> \
  <p>\
    Then run SSH like this:\
<pre class=cmd>\
$ ssh {2}.{0}\n\
$ ssh ''{3}#{2}.{0}''\n\
$ ssh ''lastFailedBuild#{2}.{0}''\n\
</pre>
